I like to take interview projects and use them to try new things and learn more about a certain tool in my toolbox. The page has been deployed using Netlify from the Create React App. After completing the react app, I chose to practice gatsby. The gatsby app has encountered a bug due to a loop that hangs the server rendering when launching locally. Once fixed, the gatsby app can be deployed to the gatsby cloud. Very similar to issue #19846 (https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/19846 ), so once I get some time, I will deploy it with gatsby.
<br/>
Albeit overly complicated for a single static webpage, it was a great oppurtunity to practice using Gatsby and try different methods of achieving an outcome. I am obsessed with optimization and learning Gatsby has allowed me to utilize server side rendering for fast performance speeds for websites in addition to the accessibility, SEO and loads of other benefits Gatsby offers. I have to admit, at times it seems overly complicated but after learning about what goes on under the hood, you get somewhat of an understanding for the complexities involved. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
